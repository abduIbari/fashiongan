# FashionGAN
This project is part of a machine learning initiative to generate fashion-related images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The model leverages the Fashion MNIST dataset to create realistic and diverse fashion item representations.

### Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items across 10 categories. Each image is 28x28 pixels, representing various fashion articles.

In this project, the dataset is utilized to train the GAN, enabling the generation of new images based on the learned features of the clothing items.

### Model Architecture
- Generator:
  - Takes random noise as input and generates synthetic images that resemble the fashion items in the dataset.
- Discriminator:
  - Evaluates the authenticity of the generated images, distinguishing between real and fake images.

The Generator and Discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive setting, allowing the Generator to improve its ability to create realistic images over time.

### Training Process:
1. The Generator creates images from random noise.
2. The Discriminator assesses the real images from the dataset and the generated images.
3. Both models are updated based on their performance, iteratively improving the image quality.

## Results
The output of this project will include generated fashion images that can be saved and visualized. You can compare these images with the original dataset to assess the quality of the GAN's performance.
